Our team at Brainhub was working on a gesture recognition bracelet, a universal gesture capturing device with its open-source platform.

We made our PCB, wrote firmware and SDK for a real-time sensor data analysis and implemented algorithms for extracting phalanges position using accelerometer, magnetometer, and gyroscope data.

### My role
I was working with:
- C++ for IMU data algorithms, position calculations and OpenGL visualization
- Qt & imGui for UI
- Unity for simulations
- Kotlin for mobile applications

We've wrote our first visualization in 2017 and won 2nd prize on [#BG10xEU hackaton](https://fond.sofia-da.eu/bg/%D1%81%D1%8A%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B5%D0%B7%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B8%D1%8F/bg10xeu-hackathon.html?start=3) trying to raise money for further research & development.
