I and my team are working on a gesture recognition bracelet, a universal gesture capturing device with its open-source platform.

We made our PCB, wrote a complete SDK for a real-time sensor data analysis and implemented algorithms for extracting phalanges position using accelerometer, magnetometer, and gyroscope data.

*Time invested: > 2 years.*
