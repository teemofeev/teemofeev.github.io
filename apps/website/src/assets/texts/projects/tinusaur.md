“Tinusaur” is an educational platform aimed at students and teachers, and a set of tools for programming, mathematics, and physics – all open-source.

It was started in 2013 and offered the hardware, software, and methodology necessary to learn these sciences in a fun and practical way.

The Tinusaur is already used by universities and schools in Bulgaria, Western Europe, and North America.

We with @tinusaur work on the Blocktinu - a web-based platform for teachers and students who are learning to write low and high-level code for IoT platforms like Arduino or Tinusaur.

We believe that kids can code so we implemented both code editor and visual block-based editor for them in our web interface.

The V2.0 prototype was written in one month.
