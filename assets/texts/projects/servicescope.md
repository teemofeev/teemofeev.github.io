An OSS marketplace for service providers.

The goal is to make it easier and more effective for people like layers, builders, seamstresses to promote their services online using completely new approach &  modern social channels.

I worked on backend services, frontend clients, devops configurations.

Things were used:
- Angular 8 & NG-Zorro for UI
- Angular Universal for server-side rendering
- Django & DRF for backend services & API
- Django Channels 2 & Redis for websocket connection 
- Docker swarm for devops
- Ngingx as a proxy
- AWS for deployment
