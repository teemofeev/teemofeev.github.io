Gameface is a high-performance cross-platform tech for creating game user interfaces using web technologies. Developed by Coherent Labs. You can read more about it here: [Gameface](https://coherent-labs.com/products/coherent-gameface/) & [C++ Documentation](https://docs.coherent-labs.com/cpp-gameface/)

**Disclaimer**: I had to quit the company due to the Ukrainian crisis of 2022 to take care of my relatives and myself. I love the culture in Coherent Labs, people working there, and I admire the whole team for their passion and work. They were supper supportive. So far this place gave me positive vibes, growth, lots of interesting problems to work on, and amazing engineers to work with. Hopefully, they'll become the de-facto standard for implementing game UIs. If you're into gaming or gamedev - check them out (either for using their products, or working with them) or contact me. I can tell you more and introduce you to them.

### My role

Worked in the Core team as a C++ Software engineer.

- Truly enjoyed my time solving interesting problems.
- Debugged complex and uncertain memory leaks, bugs, deadlocks, etc.
- Debugged dumps, reproduced, and fixed complex issues reported by our clients.
- Designed, did PoCs, and implemented multi-threaded features, improvements, web standards.
- Worked in a multi-threaded environment optimized for performance.
- Wrote regression, performance, and other tests with gtest and internal testing systems.
- Actively participated in design meetings.
- Contributed to documentation - both internal and public.
- Performed code reviews, handled complex git branching, merges, etc.
- Planned, de-risked, and split complex features into manageable achievable tasks with help of my coworkers.
- Was not afraid to jump into systems that were out of my position requirements to help, improve, or fix them.
- Helped other teams and my team members solve the problems we face.

Worked in a collaboration with the whole team, always was up for a discussion in Slack about design decisions, hypothesis brainstorming for a problem, internal processes, etc.

I was working with:
- C++ for developing the core of the product - the web engine.
- JS / HTML / CSS for testing.
- Web Standards & IDL for implementing web features.

### Highlights from my contributions:
- Designed, planned, delivered TextToSpeech feature (see [tts docs](https://docs.coherent-labs.com/cpp-gameface/integration/optional_features/texttospeech/)). Delived SpeechAPI C++ lib, SpeechAPI JS lib, and a library for ARIA implementation. Documented and made a sample for it.
- Designed and delivered Dev Tools Network tab ([devtools docs](https://docs.coherent-labs.com/cpp-gameface/content_development/devtools_js/)). Refactored resource loading flow in the whole product to achieve this.
- Made a significant contribution to design and implement Instaload feature (see [instaload docs](https://docs.coherent-labs.com/cpp-gameface/integration/optional_features/preloadedresources/instaload/)). Implemented HTML preloading.
- Helped coming up with a solution to handle a complex problem with playing specific video and audio streams. Implemented it.
- Made our WebSockets API to support binary messages and MQTT.
- Fixed a ton of problems with CSS / DOM features like leaks, problems with XHRs, WebSockets, flaky tests, stylesheets, CSSOM, mutation observers, styles resolving, complex client interfaces, simple and complex selectors.
- Improved complex selectors performance. Fixed issues in third-party code.
- And more...

*Time invested: > 1.5 years, > 500 commits, >100 PRs, ♾️ passion*

### Some observations from my collegues:

- Needs to improve decomposition and design of features and changes in larger, more complex systems
- Motivated to learn and understand, strives to solve issues on his own
- Delivered the objective to "Understand and be able to work in all core components of GF. Do non-trivial tasks in each core component".
